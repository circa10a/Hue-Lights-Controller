Bash Script for playing with Phillips Hue lights

## But why? There's an app for that.
Custom Automation? I don't know, [be creative](#mail-yourself-the-status-of-your-lights-while-youre-away)....

## Prerequisites
1) Get your own Phllips Hue API User Token by following docs [here](https://developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started)

2) Update lights array in the script with your lightID's by:
      1) First, add your user token in the script (line 11)
      2) `./hue.sh getLightsInfo | python -m json.tool`
      
#### Example Output(3 is the Light ID):

```
{
    "3": {
        "manufacturername": "Philips",
        "modelid": "LTW004",
        "name": "lamp",
